# Streamlit Dashboard Implementation Summary

## What Was Built

A fully functional interactive Streamlit dashboard that visualizes the 2025 vessel project timeline and quarterly metrics for Shearwater Competitor Analysis.

## Key Features Delivered

### 1. **Interactive Gantt-Style Timeline Chart**

✅ **All Requirements Met:**
- Months displayed on X-axis at the top (Jan through Dec)
- All 11 vessels on Y-axis (including "Island Pride (Charter)" as requested)
- Color-coded project phases:
  - **Yellow**: Mobilization & Demobilization
  - **Orange**: Deployment & Recovery  
  - **Green**: Production
  - **Light Gray**: Transit time (gaps between projects)
- Quarters clearly marked (Q1, Q2, Q3, Q4 2025) with vertical dashed lines
- Legend format: Country + Type of Survey (e.g., "India 2D", "Angola OBN")
- Interactive hover tooltips showing project details

### 2. **Vessel Quarterly Pivot Table**

✅ **All Requirements Met:**
- Shows quarterly breakdown for all vessels (Q1-Q4 2025)
- Displays:
  - Days worked per quarter
  - Average day rate
  - Total cost
- **Revenue column removed as requested**
- Sortable and searchable table
- CSV export capability

### 3. **Transit Time Calculation**

✅ The dashboard automatically detects gaps between consecutive projects for each vessel and fills them with light gray "Transit Time" bars, making it easy to see when vessels are moving between locations.

## Files Created

1. **streamlit_dashboard.py** - Main dashboard application (270+ lines)
2. **requirements.txt** - Python dependencies for easy installation
3. **DASHBOARD_GUIDE.md** - Comprehensive setup and usage instructions
4. **dashboard_screenshot.png** - Visual reference of the dashboard
5. **IMPLEMENTATION_SUMMARY.md** - This file

## Files Updated

1. **README.md** - Added Streamlit dashboard section with instructions
2. **dependencies.txt** - Added Streamlit and Plotly

## How to Use

### Quick Start (3 Steps)

1. **Install dependencies:**
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

2. **Ensure data files exist:**
   The following CSV files should be present (generated by the Jupyter notebook):
   - `Enhanced_Streamer_Projects.csv`
   - `Vessel_Quarterly_Pivot_2025.csv`

3. **Run the dashboard:**
   ```bash
   streamlit run streamlit_dashboard.py
   ```

The dashboard will automatically open in your browser at `http://localhost:8501`

### If Data Files Are Missing

If you don't have the CSV files, run the Jupyter notebook first:

```bash
jupyter notebook "Shearwater Competitor Information.ipynb"
```

Then run all cells to generate the required data files.

## Dashboard Capabilities

### Timeline Chart
- **Interactive**: Zoom, pan, and download as PNG
- **Hover Details**: See project name, vessel, phase, dates, and duration
- **Clear Visualization**: Color-coded phases make it easy to understand project status
- **Quarter Markers**: Vertical lines and labels show quarter boundaries
- **Transit Time**: Automatically calculated gaps between projects

### Vessel Table
- **Searchable**: Find specific vessels quickly
- **Sortable**: Click column headers to sort
- **Exportable**: Download as CSV for further analysis
- **Clean Display**: Revenue removed as requested, formatted numbers for easy reading

## Technical Implementation

### Technology Stack
- **Streamlit**: Web framework for the dashboard
- **Plotly**: Interactive charts and visualizations
- **Pandas**: Data processing and manipulation
- **Python 3.8+**: Programming language

### Data Processing
- Reads from CSV files generated by the Jupyter notebook
- Filters to 2025 projects only
- Handles missing dates (NaT) gracefully
- Sorts projects by vessel and date to calculate transit time
- Maps Island Pride to "Island Pride (Charter)" automatically

### Key Algorithms
1. **Transit Time Detection**: Compares end date of one project to start date of next project for the same vessel
2. **Date Filtering**: Removes any records with invalid dates to prevent errors
3. **Quarter Calculation**: Uses pandas datetime functionality to assign quarters

## Verification

✅ All requirements from the problem statement have been implemented:
- ✅ Months on X-axis at the top
- ✅ 11 vessels on Y-axis with Island Pride (Charter)
- ✅ Project duration phases displayed
- ✅ Color coding: Yellow (Mobilization/Demobilization), Orange (Deployment/Recovery), Green (Production)
- ✅ Transit time in light gray
- ✅ Quarters displayed
- ✅ Legend: Country + Type of Survey
- ✅ Vessel Quarterly Pivot table without Revenue column

## Next Steps

The dashboard is ready to use! You can:

1. Run it locally following the Quick Start guide
2. Customize colors or layout by editing `streamlit_dashboard.py`
3. Update data by running the Jupyter notebook with new CSV data
4. Deploy to Streamlit Cloud for sharing (see Streamlit documentation)
